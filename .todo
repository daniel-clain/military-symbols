Illogical:
  ☐ units that are part of a bigger formation still have an independant position. How should a sub unit be positioned relative to its parent?
  ☐ how do fights between huge units go down, if the huge unit loses sub units, does its echelon get demoted?
  ☐ if 3 sections make a platoon, and a platoon needs a higher ranking officer, then its not like one of the section leaders can lead the platoon, a new leader is required right?

Todo:
  ☐ make a unit creator in the ui
  ☐ persist the data in firbase, use firebase to generate ids



High Level Questions:
  ☐ how does terrain affect movement, combat, other
  ☐ other features, diplomacy, wealth, reputation, power
  ☐ how are units created
  ☐ how long do things take
  ☐ how do players play agianst eachother
